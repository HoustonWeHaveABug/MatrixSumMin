# MatrixSumMin

Implementation of the Hungarian algorithm, written in C.

Solver for the Reddit Daily Programmer challenge #398: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/oirb5v/20210712_challenge_398_difficult_matrix_sum/.

The code follows pretty much what is described here: https://users.cs.duke.edu/~brd/Teaching/Bio/asmb/current/Handouts/munkres.html.

The square matrix size and a flag are expected on standard input, for the program to use either a simple random generator or input to fill the matrix. The random generator works as described in this page: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/vbr56/6202012_challenge_67_difficult/.

Input files from the challenge (example / challenge / bonus) are also provided in this repository as .txt files.
